# My First Steps in C# (2018)

Contents originally created from August 2018 - January 2019

## 🚀A bit about this repository.

Welcome to my high school coding journey! This GitHub repository is a collection of projects I created in 2018, marking the beginning of my programming experience. These projects were created using C#, the language that ignited my passion for computer science and led me to pursue it in college at the University of Maryland - College Park.
## 💡 Why?

These projects are not just a showcase of my early work but also highlight my curiosity and dedication over the years. Discover how my high school journey with C# improved my technological skillset and set me on the path to a Computer Science degree.

## 🌟 Featured Project:

1️⃣ **Dworf Forest**

In high school, my computer science teacher had a passion for fantasy MMOs, which greatly inspired the idea behind this project. Using a main player, called a dworf, the player would need to be able to walk in a top-down world and transform the terrain. This project furthered my understanding of arrays, classes, and other attributes of C#.

## 📚 Looking Forward:

I've come a long way since these projects, but these represent the beginning of my coding endeavor. Join me on my ongoing journey through the world of software development.
